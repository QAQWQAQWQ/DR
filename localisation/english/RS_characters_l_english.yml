They have become accustomed to enduring the oppression of white people. They would rather huddle in the corner of Chinatown and tremble than stand up and testify about the unfair treatment they have received. Li Eun-fu knew it was time to stand up.

Dougherty, Ohio's skilled politician. When he lost his initial bid for county auditor and was elected to the state Senate as a Republican in 1899, Dougherty quickly made friends with him.\n\n Doherty was deeply impressed by the young senator's distinctive appearance and easy-going temper, so he pushed Harding into the fierce political struggle and began to manipulate his future. Under Doherty's prompting, Harding accepted the conservative nomination in 1910 and ran for governor of Ohio, but his disastrous defeat in the campaign almost ended his political career. As everyone knows, Harding's long-term loyalty to the Republican Party won the favor of the party leaders. In 1914, he was fortunate enough to be nominated as a candidate for the U.S. Senate. Harding defeated Foraker in the nomination race for the U.S. Senate and was elected to the U.S. Senate. During Harding's six years in the Senate, his work was unremarkable and unremarkable. He neither promoted any important bills nor achieved any achievements worthy of review.

In order to make up for this physical defect, William received strict military training since childhood. The harsh education methods in childhood had an extremely negative impact on William's personality development, and his character became ambitious, impulsive and reckless. After the death of William I on March 9, 1888, his father was crowned Emperor Frederick III, but died of throat cancer 99 days later. In June of the same year, 29-year-old Wilhelm II succeeded to the throne and became emperor.\n\n After he came to the throne, he had a political conflict with Bismarck. Wilhelm II believed that Bismarck was too arbitrary and affected his own political decisions. As the highest representative of the German imperialist class, Wilhelm II ordered Bismarck to resign in 1890. .\n\n William II actively pursued his own world policy and continued to expand his colonies. After the revolution in France, William II sent troops to occupy some African colonies that originally belonged to France. Even at the end of the 19th century, William II Plans to attack port cities such as New York and Boston in the United States to clear obstacles set up by the U.S. Navy, thereby clearing the way for Germany to expand its colonial rule in the Pacific. . ."

The young Meiji was impacted by the ideological trends of the times and influenced by Western civilization to varying degrees, and had lofty political ambitions to reform society.\n\n Meiji was only 15 years old when he ascended the throne. He was trained by Saigo Takamori, Kido Takayoshi, and Ito Hirobumi, among other reformers. Many samurai were recruited to serve around the emperor. They were all upright samurai who were active in the late shogunate. These samurai had a huge impact on the young Meiji. The personal spirit of "respecting heaven and loving people" deeply infected Meiji. After Meiji took office, Tokyo was designated as the capital in an attempt to calm people's hearts. We will make every effort to implement the oath of "seeking knowledge in the world" and "revitalizing the imperial foundation", and send missions to Europe to study, carry out reforms through Western experience, and realize the rejuvenation of the Yamato nation. During the reign of Emperor Meiji, Japan was the most significant period of reform. Japan achieved social, economic, military and other aspects of development.\n\n Now that Meiji is approaching the end of his life, uremia is tormenting his dying body all the time, and his life has entered a countdown."

He went from being an ordinary Mexican farmer to becoming the president.\n\n Obregon was a hard-working man, but due to the poverty of his family, he had to drop out of school. He was one of the main participants in the Mexican Revolution, but unlike most other important revolutionary leaders of the Mexican Revolution, Obregon Gon was not opposed to dictator Porfirio Díaz in his early days. Obregón's early attitude towards the revolution was in the wait-and-see stage. As the revolution gradually developed, Obregón participated in the revolutionary movement, so that later revolutionaries often accused him of being an opportunist.\n\n In the spring of 1911, the revolutionary army captured Juarez, the capital, and the Díaz regime fell. The revolutionaries welcomed Madero back to the country and became president. But Madero, who returned to Mexico, failed to fulfill the pre-revolutionary promise of land reform. On February 18, 1913, Huerta and Díaz signed the so-called "Embassy Plan" in the office of U.S. Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson, agreeing to jointly oppose Madero and make Huerta the president. The next day, Madero was arrested and forced to resign, and Huerta became president. Madero was assassinated a few days later. Poncho Vera, Alvaro Obregón and Venustiano Carranza formed an alliance. The revolutionary Carranza proposed the "Guadalupe Plan" and asked Huerta to resign. Carranza declared himself president despite Villa's objections. The country descended into chaos and bloodshed. In 1914, under the attack of Zabape and Villa peasant armies, and with the cooperation of workers' strikes and constitutionalists, Huerta stepped down and fled in July. In August, Carranza, a constitutionalist, seized power and became president.\n\n After Carranza took office as president, he decided to suppress the forces that supported Obregón and deprived Obregón of his military rank. The situation has become increasingly tense, reminding some of Mexico before the 1910 revolution. Soon, troops loyal to Obregón overthrew Carranza's government and established a government loyal to Obregón.\n\n Facts have proved that Obregón is a capable president. Land and education reforms were implemented. He also established friendly relations with the United States and did much to restore Mexico's shattered economy."

He was born in the spring of 1868. However, contrary to this mild season, the fate of the Russian Empire at this moment coincided with the arrival of cold winter - in the War of 1812, the French, led by Napoleon, advanced all the way to Moscow This area is the birthplace of Russia. Although the French withdrew from Russia soon after, this was undoubtedly a humiliating defeat for the Russian people. After the Anti-French Alliance defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, the once great and glorious Russian motherland also ushered in a shame that it will always remember: the "Warsaw Agreement." The independent status of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw was established, and the fruits of the partition of Poland among the three countries of Russia, Prussia, and Austria were misappropriated.\n\n As time went by, the Paris Uprising in 1871 plunged France into chaos. Driven by Alexander II, Russia regained the territory lost in the "Warsaw Agreement" and formed the Three Emperors Alliance to deal with the surge. of European revolutions. After the Berlin Conference, the Russian Empire also gained a new colony, the Abyssinian region. The wealth derived from the colonies brought a relatively objective income to the empire. However, this did not solve the increasingly serious survival crisis of farmers in the country. The remnants of serfdom were still harming the Russian people.\n\n The subsequent June 3 coup launched by Stolypin extinguished this glimmer of light. The Duma was dissolved, a network of military courts was established, and workers and peasants everywhere were brutally suppressed. The iron fist once again fell on the people. superior.\n\n The struggle of 1905 failed. However, the anger of the people is difficult to quell, and the wave belonging to the people will once again attack the old order. What followed was the February Revolution: Socialist Revolutionaries, Social Democrats, and thousands of working people... At this moment, all the Russian people who longed for change, freedom and power were united, just for the sake of Overthrow the tyrannical rule of the Tsar. The second revolution was once again destroyed under the iron heel of the Tsar. Hope is gone again, but this does not mean the end of the struggle.\n\n Nicholas II clearly realized that although he had won two consecutive victories, the balance of victory would not always tilt to his side. One day, he would be overthrown by the untouchables under his rule. , and what he has to do now is to stabilize the crumbling building of the Russian Empire - his predecessor has done a bad enough job, and the Romanov dynasty cannot be ruined in his hands."

He fought side by side with Cai E, the former governor of Yunnan, and others in the crusade against Yuan Shikai's national and legal protection movements, forcing Yuan Shikai to abolish the imperial system. In 1918, he became the de facto ruler of Sichuan Province. After ruling Sichuan for two years, Xiong Kewu gradually became a wallflower who bounced around between the northern and southern governments several times. He was very interested in the idea of ​​​​federal autonomy.

In retaliation, General Adolf von Trotta issued the infamous "Extermination Order" (which was also the first African genocide). General Adolf von Trotta wanted to exterminate all Herero people. . By the time the war stopped in 1907, the number of Herero people had dropped from 80,000 to 15,000. The number of Nama people dropped from 20,000 to 10,000. On the German side, 1,749 soldiers and expatriates died. After the Herero uprising was suppressed, a large amount of land was expropriated by Germany and later sold to German farmers.\n\n Although the "Extermination Order" caused dissatisfaction in some Western countries, Berlin did not pursue Adolf von Trotta's genocide."

Therefore, Sverdlov was influenced by the revolution when he was very young, and he dreamed of joining the revolutionary struggle to eradicate the arbitrary and unfair phenomena around him. In 1901, as the Russian labor movement continued to develop, Y. M. Sverdlov returned to his hometown and joined the movement, becoming an underground member of the Social Democratic Labor Party. After Lenin founded "Iskra", he took the purpose of "Iskra" as his motto to guide his practice. Therefore, his activities have received attention and praise from Iskra.\n\n The revolution broke out in Russia in 1905. At the end of that year, 21-year-old Sverdlov was sent to the Ural region to strengthen work there in order to unify the scattered forces of the party. Sverdlov is familiar with cadres, understands them, and is good at placing various talents in appropriate positions. Due to his outstanding activities, not only did the organization and propaganda work of the Yekaterinburg Committee quickly change, but he himself became a familiar organizer and speaker to the workers there.\n\n He fought to maintain Lenin's program and the Bolshevik organizational principles. Lenin once spoke highly of Sverdlov's early revolutionary activities and his dedication, saying that when he was a young man, " I will devote myself wholeheartedly to the revolution."

In fact, this is indeed the case. To put it bluntly, before the queen was born, his husband had already climbed to the top of the kingdom's power. Therefore, before the death of Prime Minister Reini in 1905, Ranavarona III was more like a popular vase, appearing to the public on behalf of the Prime Minister and playing a symbolic role, with almost no real power in his hands.\n\n It was not until the death of Prime Minister Reini after 1905 that the queen of 22 years took real power and began to rule the country in a real sense. The death of a neglected character is not a good thing for the royal family of the kingdom.\n\n With the death of the prime minister, the domestic republican and democratic parties also began a power struggle in the kingdom. Almost all of these republican democrats are composed of intellectuals from the Huka (free people). Among them, the VSS movement and its leader Jean Lalemongo are the most famous. What scares the royal family even more is that under the leadership of Prime Minister Rainieri The series of reforms left by Warney that laid the foundation for Madagascar's modernization were almost all on the Huka side. Until 1920, Huka intellectuals were found almost everywhere in the entire Kingdom of Madagascar, from grassroots officials to central departments. Almost all of these people are republican in heart and have long been unwilling to be controlled by the royal family.\n\n Unfortunately, Ranavarona III was obviously not that kind of hardliner. Although he organized several arrests of republicans, the result was that the people who were arrested and put under house arrest became famous. For example, Jean Lalemongo.\n\n All in all, the outcome of Ranavarona III and the royal family seems to be no more obvious, and the republican democrats have an absolute advantage."
